# atnetgo

atnetgo is a implementation of a client using the [netatmo-api-go](https://github.com/exzz/netatmo-api-go) lib.

It's function is to provide readout of netatmo station values. Using the command line options the output can be filterd to provide only the values you are interested in. 

Using `grep` and `awk` a single value can be extracted from the output.

The following output modes are currently avaibale:
* Pretty, for human readers
* List, for grep, awk and other cli tools
* JSON, for those that like it
* InfluxDB Line protocol, for insertion into time series database [InfluxDB](http://influxdata.com/).

## Running
Binary release is available from the Releases page: https://github.com/dhogborg/atnetgo/releases/

Currently binary release is provided for the following platforms:
* OS X (x64)
* Linux (x64)
* Linux (arm5)
* Linux (arm7)
* Windows (x64)
* Windows (386)

Using the binary you don't need to provide your own Netatmo AppID and Client secret.

## Building
Only neccessary if modifying the source. Otherwhise, look for a prebuilt binary under releases.

1. `make setup` to install godep, the tooling used for building.
1. Create a Netatmo app ID: https://dev.netatmo.com/dev/createapp, put the ID and the Client Secret in the secrets.go file (follow instructions in secrets.example.go).
1. `make build` to build the project with your current platform. `make all` to build all configured platforms separatly and package them for release.
1. `make install` to build and install the binary in your $GOPATH/bin folder.
1. Run atnetgo with the `pretty` command to see what's on your account.
1. Use `--station` and `--module` to filter by name.

Perferably specify your credentials as environment variables to avoid storing passwords in your .bash_history

## Examples
#### Print all stations and all modules
```
$ atnetgo pretty
Station: Office
	Outdoor:
		Humidity: 81
		Temperature: 10.40
	Indoor:
		Pressure: 992.40
		Temperature: 21.40
		CO2: 435
		Humidity: 39
		Noise: 40
Station: Home
	Rain:
		Rain: 0.00
	Outdoor:
		Temperature: 9.00
		Humidity: 83
	Indoor:
		Temperature: 22.00
		CO2: 1057
		Humidity: 49
		Noise: 39
		Pressure: 993.80
```

```
$ atnetgo list
Office: Outdoor: Temperature: 10.40
Office: Outdoor: Humidity: 81
Office: Indoor: Temperature: 21.40
Office: Indoor: CO2: 435
Office: Indoor: Humidity: 39
Office: Indoor: Noise: 40
Office: Indoor: Pressure: 992.40
Home: Rain: Rain: 0.00
Home: Outdoor: Temperature: 9.00
Home: Outdoor: Humidity: 83
Home: Indoor: Temperature: 22.00
Home: Indoor: CO2: 1057
Home: Indoor: Humidity: 49
Home: Indoor: Noise: 39
Home: Indoor: Pressure: 993.80
```

```
$ atnetgo json
{
	"Office": {
		"Indoor": {
			"CO2": "431",
			"Humidity": "39",
			"Noise": "37",
			"Pressure": "992.40",
			"Temperature": "21.40"
		},
		"Outdoor": {
			"Humidity": "81",
			"Temperature": "10.50"
		}
	},
	"Home": {
		"Indoor": {
			"CO2": "1171",
			"Humidity": "49",
			"Noise": "37",
			"Pressure": "994.00",
			"Temperature": "22.00"
		},
		"Outdoor": {
			"Humidity": "83",
			"Temperature": "9.00"
		},
		"Rain": {
			"Rain": "0.00"
		}
	}
}
```
The example above is prettyfied for clarity. Actual output is plain json without newlines or tabs.

#### Extracting a single value
```
$ atnetgo list | grep 'Temperature' |Â awk '{print $4}'
```
```
21.60
```
